    <p></p><b>Getting Started with HTML</b></p><b>The World Wide Web</b><br>
The internet functions as a web. It is made up of <em>servers</em>, which host files written in HTML for internet browsers to interpret. When someone wants to go to a website their computer sends an HTTP request to a server, which then sends back the appropriate HTML document for their web browser to interpret.<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b><br><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> documents contain <em>text content</em> which is the buidling blocks for what the web page will look like when viewed through a browser. To write in HTML one uses a series of different <em>tags</em> that surround <em>elements</em>which tell the browser how to display the content. Some of these elements can be described as <em>inlnine</em>or <em>block</em> elements.<br>
<br>
When writing code it is important to remember that computers are stupid. Meaning that they are extremely literal and can't make simple corrections that a human could. For example, a small typo could ruin an entire section of code because the computer will only read it exactly how it is written.<br>
